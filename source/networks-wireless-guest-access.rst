Networks:: Wireless:: Guest Access
==================================

SGS Guests can access the SGS-Guest-Wireless network by grabbing a "fortune pass" from the Front Desk fishbowl.

Each of these passes is good for a 24 hour run.

Historically, the SGS-Guest-Wireless network had the most restrictive filtering ( 5th Grade Filter ). Now, with the captive portal, those restrictions are slowly being lifted.

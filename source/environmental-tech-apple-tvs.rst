Campus Tech:: Apple TVs
=======================

2015-2016 we started deploying Apple TV's as alternate connections to overhead projectors.

The Apple TVs are named after their location. The password for the Apple TVs is their name.

For example, Apple TV "CMR" has a password of "CMR". Passwords are case sensitive.

.. caution:: Apple TVs and Sound Output

   - Apple TVs assume end projector has a valid sound system. Not all ceiling projectors are wired for sound.
   - This is a common stumbling block for faculty and guests ( switch audio out )

.. caution:: Apple TVs and Exclusive Clients

   Apple TVs don't "lock" in the current client, so other people can hijack your broadcast session.

.. warning:: Poor Performance with DVD Playback

   It has been observed that there can be poor playback quality when playing DVDs via AirPlay. We recommend either using VLC for playback or switch to hard wired VGA line.

.. hint:: Can Not See Display on Projector

   Be sure that the projector is set to use the HDMI channel as input and not the VGA channel.

.. note:: Completing Deployment Summer 2016

   - We will be completing the installation of Apple TVs in the remaining classrooms ( 6th & 7th )
   - We will be using an HDMI Video/Audio splitter to connect speakers in classrooms with projectors with no sound out

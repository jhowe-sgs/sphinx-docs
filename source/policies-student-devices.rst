Policies:: Student Devices
==========================

In general, no student devices are allowed on campus.

The only current exception to this rule is Kindles for Reading Workshops ( student Kindles are not allowed on the SGS Wireless Networks ).

This policy evolves out of many factors, predominately:

- Legal compliance ( easier to provide curated experience via SGS laptops )
- Anti-Bias framework ( BYOD conflicts with economic diversity )
- Network resources ( limited bandwidth, technology support, etc. )

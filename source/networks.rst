The campus has a wide variety of new and old tech.

Most swicthes, routers, wireless nodes and inter-building cabling is new.

Buildings North and South have clusters of Cat5? wiring connected to patch panels. This wiring is at least 10 years old as of 2016. It was originally run by Rick Park and Rosetta Lee.

Late 2015, we replaced all the core inter-building wiring and replaced the phone lines from the phone room to the E buildings.

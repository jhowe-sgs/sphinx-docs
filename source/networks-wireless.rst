Networks:: Wireless
===================

Historically, the campus started with Apple Wireless nodes in each classroom.

Each classroom had a SID named after the classroom. These devices were problematic as they lacked centralize management, and made roaming difficult.

In 2011?, we upgraded the campus to a fleet of Aruba 105's with new 3COM POE swicthes.

We are currently experiencing performance issues with the 105s as wireless technology improves.

Specifically, poor performance is noted when:

- Moving large files across the network ( >= 5G )
- Sharing large files with AirDrop
- Multiple clients on AirDrop
- Large Provisioning passes on wireless ( >= 20G )

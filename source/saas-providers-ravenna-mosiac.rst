SaaS Providers:: Ravenna Admit
==============================

Ravenna Admit ( aka Mosiac ) is an admissions application from Ravenna Solutions.

I beleive we subscribed to the simple model in the past ( < $1k/year ). There are some value added modules that are pushing the costs to $6K/year.

Ravenna has a niche market where it serves all local Seattle NWAIS schools and makes it easy for parent to apply to multiple schools.

Speak with Colleen/Erika about other services they provide.

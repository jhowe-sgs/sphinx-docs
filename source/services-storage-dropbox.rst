Services:: Storage:: Dropbox
============================

Currently, SGS does not support Dropbox officially as an organization share, since it is outside backup circuits.

It has also been observed employees sharing sensitive SGS data via personal Dropbox accounts.

.. note::

   However, all locally installed Dropbox shares are captured by the CrashPlan Pro service.

.. warning::

   Needs policy work

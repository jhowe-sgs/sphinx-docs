Campus Evolution
================

In 2007, the campus consisted of the two main buildings ( North and South, known as Canada and Mexico respectively ). The campus also had a storage presence in E-4.

E-4 was later built out as a busines office.

Over time, E-2 was acquired and replaced E-4 as the new business office.

Then E-6 ( used to be a Karate School ) which was used for storage mostly.

E-1 ( Oromo Church ) which became an A & W space.

Then E-5 which became the music lab ( hair dressor parlor ).

The Singh House was donated later and the Sharon Hammel Garden inducted.

The Residential House was the final acquisition. At one point it was considered for a new Business Office.

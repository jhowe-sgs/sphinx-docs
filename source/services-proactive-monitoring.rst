Services:: Proactive Monitoring
===============================

The Tech department monitors all network elements with Icinga/Icinga2 software.

Depending on the element, the system is configured to send out service disruption notices to delegated groups.

For example, if the 7th Grade East printer runs out of paper or gets jammed, it sends a notification e-mail to the 7th Grade Teachers and Students.

.. tip::

   In practice, most students and teachers don't seem to recognize that addressing the notification resolves the e-mail notices.

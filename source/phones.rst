Historically, the school was equipted with a Telrad system. We replaced it with a Mitel 5000 when the vendor went out of business and parts were no longer available.

The Mitel 5000 allowed us to preserve the legacy digital phone campus wiring while converting to a SIP/VOIP hybrid system.

The Mitel 5000 allows for VM to e-mail and user programmable call-forwarding.

.. warning:: Non-Standard Wiring

   Some ports are wired incorrectly on the pairs.
   The original installers did not follow common specs and you will encounter pair reversals. Some phones have small converter boxes attached to them to work around this issue.

.. warning:: Single Point of Failure

   If the Mitel 5000 box fails, we will be without phone/fax/conference services.

   Call Tri-Tec for support.

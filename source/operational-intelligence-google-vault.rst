Operational Intelligence:: Google Vault
=======================================

Google Vault was a paid solution a few years ago. Google changed their policy and made it free for all GAFE users.

Basically, it keeps a copy of all electronic communications ( including drafts ).

This would be used for legal discovery and/or data recovery.

Operational Intelligence:: Prey
===============================

Prey is an anti-theft software installed on all SGS devices that leave the campus.

This software allows for remotely shutting down and/or wiping devices that have been stolen.

It is mostly used for user compliance for summer maintenance cycles.

   Depending on the savvy of the thief, they can easily disable protections by re-imaging the device. This can be countered with a firmware password, however, that can be countered as well.

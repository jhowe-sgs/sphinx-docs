Services:: Authentication
=========================

All SGS accounts use single sign on services when ever possible.

The Active Directory is connected to the GAFE servers. Accounts are synced manually upon creation, deletion and deactivation.

Credentials are mirrored from the AD server to GAFE using the Google Password sync service.

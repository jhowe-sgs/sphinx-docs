SaaS Providers:: Historical:: ORCAS
===================================

ORCAS was a simple Student Information System web app.

We terminated the contract with ORCAS the summer of 2015 to save operation costs ( $4K ).

ORCAS provided:

- Parent Family Directory
- Transcript Store for Students
- Transcript Delivery system for Parents
- Attendance system
- Registration system ( collect medical records, releases, vaccination reports, etc )

It was replaced with a simple GAFE solution using Google Form Components for 2015-2016 ( attendance, registration )

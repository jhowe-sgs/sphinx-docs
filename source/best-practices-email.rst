Best Practices:: E-Mail
=======================

Follow the recommendations of the e-mail charter: http://emailcharter.org/

I assume people do not read the body of the message, so I try to make the Subject line the content holder of the message.

Don't cc/bcc people unless absolutely necessary.

Don't feel you need to respond immediately.

Activate the 30-second remorse call-back feature in GMail.

Services:: GAFE:: Calendaring
=============================

Calendars are served by GAFE. This allows for many different devices to subscribe to calendars.

Calendars can quickly become unwieldy, especially when there are multiple managers.

Calendars are current split between internal ( SGS staff & students ) and external clients ( parents & public ).

Basically, the Tech department follows the "buffet" methodology here, where users can make their own calendar compositions from context mapped calendars.

For instance, the client maps the following:

- Internal Calendar
- Sports Events
- SGS Birthdays

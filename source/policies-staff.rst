================

In addition to enforcing the SGS RUP, the following best practices are suggested:

SGS E-Mail is for SGS related work only. Please spin up a personal e-mail for personal use. Do **not** link your personal banking with SGS accounts.

Do **not** share accounts/account passwords.

Staff is expected to only use the sgs-guest account when accessing other users systems.

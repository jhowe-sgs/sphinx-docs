=======================================

Advancement/Admissions had a sort run with BlackBaud's RaiserEdge for Admissions process ( before Ravenna Admit ).

This purchase was made by the Board Finance committee against caveats from the Operations team.

Start up costs were $20-28K initially with $12k annual fees.

A very expensive solution to manage 150+ records.

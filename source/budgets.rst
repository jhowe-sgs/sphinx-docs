Budgets
=======

Tech planning looks ahead at least 3-5 years.

Currently, we are in steady state for OpEx.

CapEx is in a long sine wave pattern reflecting 1:1 purchases for students with a 4-5 year replacement cycle.

Server equipment should last at least 5 years.

Network equipment is more challenging to maintain long investment cycles as wireless technology continues to improve.

Currently, we have outgrown our existing Aruba 105 fleet, and new models require POE+ enabled switches to operate properly.

CapEx is usually acquired with either 3 or 4 year term leases with $1 buyouts. CapEx >= $5k usually requires Board Approval.
